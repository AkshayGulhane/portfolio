## Features

The whole [portfolio](https://matthiaskretschmann.com) is a React-based Single Page App built with [Gatsby v2](https://www.gatsbyjs.org).

### One data file to rule all pages

All content is powered by one YAML file, [`data/projects.yml`](data/projects.yml) where all the portfolio's projects are defined. The project description itself is transformed from Markdown.

Gatsby automatically creates pages from each item in that file utilizing the [`src/templates/Project.jsx`](src/templates/Project.jsx) template.

### Theme switcher

Includes a theme switcher which allows user to toggle between a light and a dark theme. Switching between them also happens automatically based on time of day.

If you want to know how, have a look at the respective component under [`src/components/molecules/ThemeSwitch.jsx`](src/components/molecules/ThemeSwitch.jsx)

### SEO component

Includes a SEO component which automatically switches all required `meta` tags for search engines, Twitter Cards, and Facebook OpenGraph tags based on the browsed route/page.

If you want to know how, have a look at the respective component under [`src/components/atoms/SEO.jsx`](src/components/atoms/SEO.jsx)

### Client-side vCard creation

The _Add to addressbook_ link in the footer automatically creates a downloadable vCard file on the client-side, based on data defined in `data/meta.yml`.

If you want to know how, have a look at the respective component under [`src/components/atoms/Vcard.jsx`](src/components/atoms/Vcard.jsx)

### Matomo (formerly Piwik) analytics tracking

Site sends usage statistics to my own [Matomo](https://matomo.org) installation. To make this work in Gatsby, I created and open sourced a plugin, [gatsby-plugin-matomo](https://github.com/kremalicious/gatsby-plugin-matomo), which is in use on this site.

### Project images

All project images live under `src/images` and are automatically attached to each project based on the inclusion of the project's `slug` in their filenames.

All project images make use of the excellent [gatsby-image](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-image) plugin, working in tandem with [gatsby-plugin-sharp](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-plugin-sharp) and [gatsby-transformer-sharp](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-transformer-sharp).

All together, Gatsby automatically generates all required image sizes for delivering responsible, responsive images to visitors, including lazy loading of all images. Also includes the [intersection-observer polyfill](https://github.com/w3c/IntersectionObserver) to make lazy loading work properly in Safari.

All project images use one single component defined in [`src/components/atoms/ProjectImage.jsx`](src/components/atoms/ProjectImage.jsx). In there, one main GraphQL query fragment is defined, which then gets used throughout other GraphQL queries.

### Importing SVG assets

All SVG assets under `src/images/` will be converted to React components before every build. Makes use of `SVGR` so SVG assets can be imported like so:

```js
import Logo from './components/svg/Logo'
```

That's done with a simple bash script under [`src/scripts/svg.sh`](src/scripts/svg.sh)

### Typekit component

Includes a component for adding the Typekit snippet.

If you want to know how, have a look at the respective component under [`src/components/atoms/Typekit.jsx`](src/components/atoms/Typekit.jsx)

## Development

```bash
git clone git@github.com:kremalicious/portfolio.git
cd portfolio/

npm i
npm start
```

### Linting

ESlint, Prettier, and Stylelint are setup for all linting purposes:

```bash
npm run lint
```

To automatically format all code files:

```bash
npm run format
npm run format:css
```

### Add a new project

To add a new project, run the following command. This adds a new item to the top of the `projects.yml` file, creating the title & slug from the argument:

```bash
npm run new -- "Hello"
```

Then continue modifying the new entry in [`data/projects.yml`](data/projects.yml).

Finally, add as many images as needed with the file name format and put into `src/images/`:

```
portfolio-SLUG-01.png
portfolio-SLUG-02.png
portfolio-SLUG-03.png
...
```

## Deployment

Automatic deployments are triggered upon successful tests & builds on Travis:

- push to `master` initiates a live deployment
- any Pull Request, and subsequent pushes to it, initiates a beta deployment

The deploy command simply calls the [`scripts/deploy.sh`](scripts/deploy.sh) script, syncing the contents of the `public/` folder to S3:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

The deploymeng script can be used locally too, the branch checks are only happening for Travis builds, allowing to deploy any branch from local machine.
