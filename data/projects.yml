  description: >
    From 2012 to 2015 I worked at ezeep, where I created an unprecedented, market-leading & award-winning user experience based on the principles of emotional design way ahead of all competitors. This included conceptualizing executing, and iterating on the creative & visual direction of the ezeep brand.

    I was leading the UI design & development of all ezeep touch points and - as a product designer - defined the ezeep product based on user and market research in an iterative process. On top of that, I designed and helped building all app experiences of ezeep on Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android.

    ezeep was acquired by [Cortado AG](https://www.cortado.com) in 2015 and became part of their [ThinPrint Cloud Services](https://www.thinprintcloud.com) suite of products.

    So, what to do when everyone seem to release iPad icons but fail to
    include some crisp small size icons? Pushing the pixels for yourself of course.
    So here’s my take on the smaller sizes of an Apple iPad icon, called iPixelPad
    in the sizes 48px, 32px and 16px.
